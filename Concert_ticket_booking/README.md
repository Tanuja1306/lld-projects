âœ… Requirement Analysis
Users can search for concerts/events based on city, artist, venue, or date.

Users can view event details, seat layout, pricing, and availability.

Allows seat selection and booking.

Implements temporary seat locking during payment.

Supports multiple payment methods.

Sends confirmation via email/SMS after successful booking.

Admin can add/update events, manage venues, and view bookings.

Ticket cancellation and refund policies must be handled.

Concurrency control to prevent double booking.

Scalable system to support high traffic and large events.

Configurable pricing per seat type/row/section.

Audit logging for all booking/cancellation/payment events.

Support for discounts, promo codes, and loyalty points.

Shows real-time availability and seat map updates.

ðŸ“Œ Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Scalability: System should scale to handle large-scale events with tens of thousands of users concurrently.

Availability: 99.9% uptime to ensure users can book tickets anytime.

Performance: Seat availability and booking response time should be < 300 ms under normal load.

Concurrency Handling: Ensure atomic operations to avoid double booking of seats.

Security:

Protect payment and user information with encryption (TLS/SSL).

Ensure secure APIs with authentication and authorization.

Fault Tolerance: In case of failures (e.g., payment gateway timeout), system must rollback locks and maintain consistency.

Reliability: Guarantee no loss of booking data or payment records under failure.

Extensibility: New features (promo types, payment gateways, venues) should be added with minimal code changes.

Configurability: Seat pricing, lock timeout, refund policies should be runtime configurable.

Maintainability: Code should follow clean architecture to allow for easy debugging and enhancements.

Testability: Unit and integration testing support with mocks for external systems (payment, SMS, etc.).

Auditability: All critical operations (booking, payment, refund, lock expiry) should be logged for audit trails.

ðŸ§± SOLID Principles
S - SRP: Each class (UserService, PaymentService, SeatManager) handles one responsibility.

O - OCP: New payment methods, seat pricing strategies can be added via extension.

L - LSP: Any custom booking logic or payment gateway integrates without breaking core.

I - ISP: Separate interfaces for search, booking, payment, and notification.

D - DIP: Services depend on abstractions (e.g., IPaymentGateway), not concrete implementations.

ðŸ§© Design Patterns Used
Strategy: Seat pricing strategies (VIP, Early Bird, etc).

Factory: For creating payment gateway instances.

Observer: For sending notifications (email/SMS) post-booking.

State: Payment process states â€“ Initiated, Pending, Success, Failed.

Singleton: ConfigurationManager or SeatLockManager shared across system.

Builder: For constructing complex Booking objects with optional fields.

ðŸ§± Core Classes
1. User

userId, name, email, phone

Bookings list

2. Event

eventId, name, artist, date, time, venueId

seatMap, pricingInfo

3. Venue

venueId, name, location, totalSeats

seatLayout (2D matrix or section-based)

4. Seat

seatId, row, column, type (VIP/REG), price

status (available/booked/locked)

5. SeatLockManager (Singleton)

lockSeat(eventId, seatId, userId)

isLocked(seatId)

releaseExpiredLocks()

TTL-based locking, periodic cleanup

6. Booking

bookingId, userId, eventId, selectedSeats, totalAmount

status (PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED)

paymentInfo

7. BookingService

createBooking(userId, eventId, seatIds)

Validates availability and locks seats

8. PaymentService

initiatePayment(bookingId, amount)

verifyPaymentStatus()

9. IPaymentGateway (Interface)

pay(amount)

refund(paymentId)

Implementations:

RazorPayGateway

StripeGateway

MockGateway

10. NotificationService (Observer)

Sends emails/SMS

Subscribed to booking events

11. EventService

addEvent(), updateEvent(), getEventById()

Admin-facing functionality

12. SearchService

searchByArtist(), byCity(), byDate()

13. AuditLogger

Logs every action (booking, cancellation, lock, refund)

ðŸ”„ System Flow
Search for events â†’ SearchService

View seat layout & pricing â†’ EventService â†’ Venue + Seat

Select seats â†’ System checks if available and locks them â†’ SeatLockManager

Initiate booking â†’ BookingService creates a temporary Booking

Redirect to Payment Gateway â†’ PaymentService + IPaymentGateway

On payment success, booking is confirmed, locked seats are booked

NotificationService sends confirmation

In case of timeout or failure, locked seats are released by SeatLockManager

ðŸ”® Future Scope
Integration with Kafka for event-based systems.

Support for multi-currency and internationalization (i18n).

Admin dashboard with analytics and event performance.

Dynamic pricing based on demand (surge pricing).

QR Code ticket generation and scanning support at venue.

Geo-location-based recommendations.

Integration with external CRMs for targeted marketing.

Social media sharing and referral program integration.
